<h1> OUR STRATEGY
<p> MHLK Foundation turns the old strategic model on its head, redefining the limits and reach of what a Foundation can do. Its impact will not be limited to a few, with direct, sustainable benefits cascading to all of humanity. The Foundation will own major shares in companies whose business model, technology, mandate, and/or mission aligns with our humanitarian and environmental goals. As each of these companies grow, the collective value of the Foundationâ€™s ownership stakes will benefit its members. Furthermore, as assets are pledged, purchased, or recovered, those assets add to the collective value of the Foundation further benefiting its members.
